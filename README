Beanstreamy
===========

A simple utility library for the Beanstream payment gateway. Currently includes a helper method for using beanstream's hosted payment page.

Example
=======

After setting your merchant id and hash key in the initializer file, you can create a form to submit to the hosted payment page using:

<% beanstream_hosted_payment_form :order_id => 5, :amount => 34.45 do -%>
  <!-- any other beanstream fields you'd like to submit, e.g. ordName. -->
  <%= submit_tag "Checkout with Beanstream" %>
<% end -%>
