=============================================================================

There are two settings you need to specify in the 
config/initializers/beanstreamy.rb file:

  1. Your Beanstream merchant id.

  2. Your hash key for hash validation. You can turn on hash validation and 
     set your hash key on the "order settings" page in your Beanstream account.

After these are set, you'll be able to generate a form for the hosted payment 
page in your views with:

<% beanstream_hosted_payment_form :order_id => 5, :amount => 34.45 do -%>
  <!-- any other beanstream fields you'd like to submit, e.g. ordName. -->
  <%= submit_tag "Checkout with Beanstream" %>
<% end -%>
