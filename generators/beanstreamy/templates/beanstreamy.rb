# You'll need to set your merchant_id and hash key for hash validation. You can turn on hash validation
# and set your hash key in your Beanstream account in the "order settings" section.

# If you use your own payment page on Beanstream's secure webspace, you can set that here:
# Beanstreamy.config.payment_url = "https://www.beanstream.com/scripts/payment/payment.asp"

# Set your merchant id here
Beanstreamy.config.merchant_id = "000000000"

# Set your hash key here
Beanstreamy.config.hash_key    = ""

# If you use your own approval page, you can set that here:
# Beanstreamy.config.approved_url = "/some/path"

# If you use your own declined page, you can set that here:
# Beanstreamy.config.declined_url = "/some/path"

# If you use your own error page, you can set that here:
# Beanstreamy.config.error_url = "/some/path"
